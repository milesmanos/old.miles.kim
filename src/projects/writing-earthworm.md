I. Summit‍
‍
We stop to watch the view.

Small movement

grasshopper on the rock
animates the void

—

Drawing the white foam of the waves

I, the scribe
scribbling

—

Wake of the boat

Road, black

Trees shaking their branches
over the rocks

Occurring too fast

—

Totem: white wall of the museum; center, or home of the dispossessed; place of lineage; place of ultimate stillness

‍
‍
II. Descent
‍
Earthworm on the forest floor

quivering between
over and under
out and in

I, too,
scratching

—

Squeezed in the comfort of corners in the forest
‍
and out again, over the rocks

I, over

under the cover of over

—

We stopped to talk of the tree branches twisting and shouldering around each other for light, their forms shaped by this migration from the forest floor

Not one but a series, generations moving upward

—

Back then the world was not a world of material.
Anything could happen there. And when the earthquakes came, those people
sank into the deepest terror imaginable; it was more than just shaking in their bodies

—

Rain falls: shiver

—

f: floor; firm footing; the sound of contact

I: the mark in the sheets of paper; place of self; place of ultimate stillness; totem

o: home; notebook; reverberating sound of the interior

sc: squirming; scratching; sound of the scribe

—

From below, he waved us down to join
‍

‍
III. House

‘like a cornered animal
he fought’

but each of us backed to our last wall
facing out
