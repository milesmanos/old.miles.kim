**I. Summit‍**

‍We stop to watch the view.

Small movement

grasshopper on the rock<br>
animates the void

—

Drawing the white foam of the waves

I, the scribe<br>
scribbling

—

Wake of the boat

Road, black

Trees shaking their branches<br>
over the rocks

Occurring too fast

—

Totem: white wall of the museum; center, or home of the dispossessed; place of lineage; place of ultimate stillness

<br>

**II. Descent**

‍Earthworm on the forest floor

quivering between<br>
over and under<br>
out and in

I, too,<br>
scratching

—

Squeezed in the comfort of corners in the forest
‍
and out again, over the rocks

I, over

under the cover of over

—

We stopped to talk of the tree branches twisting and shouldering around each other for light, their forms shaped by this migration from the forest floor

Not one but a series, generations moving upward

—

Back then the world was not a world of material.<br>
Anything could happen there. And when the earthquakes came, those people<br>
sank into the deepest terror imaginable; it was more than just shaking in their bodies

—

Rain falls: shiver

—

f: floor; firm footing; the sound of contact

I: the mark in the sheets of paper; place of self; place of ultimate stillness; totem

o: home; notebook; reverberating sound of the interior

sc: squirming; scratching; sound of the scribe

—

From below, he waved us down to join

<br>

**III. House**

like a cornered animal<br>
he fought

but each of us backed to our last wall<br>
facing out
