We spend much of the afternoon drawing pictures in our notebooks<br>
and moving bare feet through the grass. It’s wet on our feet.<br>
The grass is wet on the earth, and it’s cold outside.

In the cafe it is impossible to believe<br>
that our parents met so young, like us, with no clear plan.<br>
Now we’re sitting across from each other,

each one of us drinking a hot drink with steam in our glasses,<br>
your chamomile, and my hot cocoa. We don’t like coffee,<br>
it makes us frantic as little birds.

You’re only here for the day, but for the moment,<br>
silence is better.<br>
We draw pictures again.

This is me: a bubble, with a bulge, a quirk.<br>
This is you: another bubble, with another quirk.<br>
They are overlapped and shaded, which makes you smile.

A line: this is the ground.<br>
Our brother, who is not here right now: he is a building,<br>
foundations carved deep into the earth, spire shooting upward.

I am a nearby tree, shorter, and wide,<br>
branching in all directions and reaching into the dark with my roots.<br>
They don’t touch, the building and the tree.

But we are here, on the Earth the three of us,<br>
and always in our human forms. In my mind we are on a hill.<br>
We are as tall as windmills.
