Gildable was my first commissioned product, an NFT platform. After working on UX wireframes, I was brought on as head of product. I was took their concept – a celebrity trading card platform backed by the blockchain – and readied for launch. This involved intense work with developers and very short timelines.

The product doesn’t exist anymore, but it set the foundation for all of my work since. Thanks to my friend Brody West for taking a chance on me.
