Orange spray paint on the sidewalk:<br>
_OB OB OB OB_<br>
notes for construction

The people walking<br>
as though the letters are<br>
not underneath their feet

not crying out

—

Sometimes against my will I write a poem<br>
It is terrible, like making a painting

—

Scrambling to be seen

—

(in class, after the bike ride)

Pumping the pedals<br>
‘pumping the pedals’

Living in my head<br>
living in a notebook

—

Obviously writing is communicating<br>
in the sense that before it was in and now it is out

That is all I know

—

Still, there are the unknown notebooks
