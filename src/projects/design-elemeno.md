Elemeno was my first commissioned website. A team of my brother’s friends developed into a full-fledged consultancy. With no photos and one case study, I leaned into simplicity. Lack of content can mean emptiness… or possibility.

The name Elemeno (LMNO) reminded me of lettered blocks – a welcome metaphor for learning and building. Sculpting a cube with a vector combines the feeling of childlike curiosity with advanced engineering. I picked Neue Haas Unica for its tone: no-nonsense but warm, clean but personable. It had the right feeling for a small, cutting edge, collaborative company like Elemeno.

Elemeno was eventually acquired by B2W, the largest online retailer in Brazil.
