We drove to the lighthouse<br>
that was off on the island

so they put on their wetsuits

swam the whole way

went the whole way there

—

‘Our windows were oceans<br>
and our houses were planets’

—

The rocks had the appearance of being undisturbed, or unable to be bothered; they dropped gradually into the ocean and seemed to continue that gesture for miles.

—

When the sun came, it came with a force
