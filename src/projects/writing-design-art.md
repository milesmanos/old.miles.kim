Design and art are both about embodiment. Design is about _posture_, and art is about _gesture_. Design is about presentation, art is about what is presented.

## Products / Pieces

Things made by the design process are _products_. Things made by the artistic process are _pieces_. You know intuitively that saying _art product_ or _design piece_ is wrong.

The artistic process creates a _piece_ of the world. The artist understands how to channel the world’s qualities into a form. The designer, on the other hand, makes a _product_. Like a farmer fostering a healthy plot of land, the designer aligns with natural processes in hopes of a good yield.

In Tibetan, the word drala means “the magical quality of existence, or natural wisdom” (from _Shambhala, the Sacred Path of the Warrior_). Design is summoning _drala_; art is embodying it.

## Close / Far

Humans design to live. We are machetes through the bamboo forest, prows through the ocean — so that we arrive back at nature. This arrival is art. We design to approach that thing that’s fundamentally out of reach.

The beauty of nature is that it hides. You can sit in a forest for any length of time, and new ways to perceive it will continuously present themselves. New creatures, new sounds, new revelations. In contrast, the beauty of design is that it comes right up to us. Design is _close_ and nature is _far_.

Functionality is when you’re allowed to be close. Awe is when you’re allowed to be far.

Meaning is a simultaneous, non-conflicting closeness and distance, like sitting next to an old, familiar friend to watch the sun rising over a new day. Or an old drawer spun out of an oak tree. Or a necklace made out of lion’s teeth, following the line of the collarbone.

In the same sense that science and meditation are both means to understanding, design and art must be handled in tandem but preserved in contrast.

## Design / Art sit on the same axis as:

Journey / Vista<br>
Trellis / Vines<br>
Hand of God / Image of God<br>
Structure / Fluid<br>
System / Life<br>
Speech / Song<br>
Distinctions / Oneness<br>
Body / Soul<br>
How / Why<br>
Toward / Beyond
