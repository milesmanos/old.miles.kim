On the train, things seen once:

Egret, statue of the marsh border

Symbol of me in the truss

—

There is the life I live

There is the man with the swollen leg<br>
whimpering through the subway

There is the building of brick and metal, covered in grime

—

The wall is a bare pastel of irrelevant color:<br>
somewhere the math is wrong.<br>
I have forgotten where to construct the metaphor.

—

The last time I remember peace I was by the ocean.

I was not at peace, but I saw it. It was simply<br>
a movement in the harbor, the boats and planes in their<br>
routes through the Boston harbor<br>
the drunk people in their yachts shouting<br>
the musicians roaring by the hotel<br>
the dogs with short legs pulled along<br>
the ladybugs in the cobblestone cracks and<br>
the mosquitoes biting at the ankles

And none of us were at peace, and the harbor was at peace.
