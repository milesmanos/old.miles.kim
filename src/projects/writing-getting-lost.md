I often find myself around cows, sloping around, looking for a place to be. In a field along the Lost Coast, I awoke to one outside my car window, a large black bull whinnying in distress. He must have stumbled through the fog and come across my car, frightened by the harsh piece of metal. Tight-chested, I crawled into the driver’s seat, left my spot while the stars were still out. I didn’t stop driving, drove through the ranches winding upward. I felt the sun sloping up the opposite hillside.

I was driving north to see an old friend. I stopped at a beach. I’d forgotten to lock my car.

I thought about, of all things, my scarf, a woolen white one with stark navy stripes, an artifact of my personal archaeology. Worn along the edges, perhaps from dragging across rough terrain. Bits of sand, burrs. Never washed.

I left the thought and watched the ocean again, feeling naked.

Not just the beauty but the brutality of it:

The sea anemones barricading the rocks<br>
The starfish like roaming hands tearing at things in shells<br>
The seagulls prowling above (nothing escapes their sight)<br>
The surfer at the edge, facing out

Sleeping on remote roads makes you aware of fear. It’s not abstract, like it is in the city. In my mind I saw a black bear roaming.

It was all there, the whole forest. I was face-to-face with it.

_It’s winter but the buds are coming._<br>
_I sleep on the moss and when I wake I see them up close, coming through every trodden crevice, little green things in the dust_<br>
_in that little canyon I won’t find again, not far but small, therefore far —_<br>
_And the buds so small, coming in from far —_<br>
_The red spider, frantic with hunger_<br>
_as hunters are, searching the dust and everywhere, it can’t let a thing go by._<br>
_Remember the dark rooms? Shuffling the papers —_<br>
‍*I feel a hunter in myself*

Along the route, little knowing interactions with loners. A stone collector. An astrophysicist. You go in one direction and pass by someone going in the other.

Bigger contradictions as I enter the city. Sharp-edged buildings against the ocean, people dressed in violent colors, spires cutting clouds. Lightning retaliates.<br>
More retaliations: disgusting alleyways, disgusting canals with grime and dark waters. Horrible creatures accumulating in the filth. Rotting metal structures.<br>
(At the edges, roads turn to paths, which meet rivers and streams – driven insistently toward them. People talking and laughing in the dark woods. By day, a trailer shining in a clearing by a lake.)

I pulled into a clearing. There was dew on my boots and my toes felt the cold. The redwoods faced me and I couldn’t see around them. I was terrified, started my car and left.

From a posting at the campsite: ‘If you come across a cougar, appear large, back away slowly, and DO NOT BREAK EYE CONTACT.’
