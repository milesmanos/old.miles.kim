After my grandfather passed away, I drove with George to a park by the ocean.<br>
Not sad exactly, just a faint remorse.<br>
I hardly knew him.

I didn't say anything on the way, didn't say anything there<br>
Except, let's go this way<br>
Down the straight path along the rocks that buffer the ocean.<br>
The waves were long, straight waves that crashed on the rocks<br>
and the sunset —

The 3 jets from Pearl Harbor tore up the sky<br>
And we felt the vibrations travel through the distances,<br>
from well behind the jets

The shock of space

—

I walked out into the ocean where the rocks jut out to form a barrier<br>
Smelled the ocean as itself, as if for the first time

I saw the movement of foam on the rocks, harsh and writhing in all directions,<br>
And the ragged woman eating alone past the dropoff, away from the path.

A movement of thought: I never knew the man. Shock of movement
