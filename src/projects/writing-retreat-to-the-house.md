It rained the whole time.<br>
We had gone far to get out and away, to get in the house

just as the sun set over<br>
Massachusetts.

The rain came at dark,<br>
we were sleeping when it came.

We were on the docks when it left and it was night again.<br>
Kai took off his hood; I had none; we were outside.

The music from a few hours agoâ€”so far away.<br>
We were outside of our lives then, too,

drunk and rhythmic, deep,<br>
deep in rhythm, nothing and nowhere to hide
