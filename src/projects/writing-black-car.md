The headlights open a clearing ahead<br>
like a page of a book from childhood

—

I used to come here often and stop by the roadside. The hills would appear<br>
as layers that disappeared into fog<br>
or opened into the bay, white with an excess of light

Now in the black hills there are forms<br>
in the bushes and trees I can’t see;<br>
I’ve come to be sheltered from them

—

I remember you said that you liked the rain<br>

Why you said it, in what place and with what tone of voice,<br>
I don’t

—

And a year later<br>
on the afternoon of the snowy pond<br>
when I wanted you again—

I still feel the wanting.<br>
It’s far, like a thought of a whale
